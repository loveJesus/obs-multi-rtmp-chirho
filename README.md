# OBS Multi-RTMP Plugin (Adapted for OBS 30.x)

This plugin is an adaptation of SoraYuki's original OBS Multi-RTMP plugin (https://github.com/sorayuki/obs-multi-rtmp), updated to work with OBS 30.x.

## A Message of Hope

As a follower of Jesus Christ, I believe in sharing a message of an eternal life of love. The Bible tells us:

"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life." - John 3:16

This project is offered for free, but much more undeserving are we of God's love which is freely available to all. This is in spite of us sinning so gravely before Him that we justly deserve His wrath, but if we choose to surrender to living lives of Love, to be transformed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ, we will be set free from all that causes hate and death, and have a relationship with God almighty.   If you're curious about the Christian faith or seeking hope in your life, I encourage you to explore the teachings of Jesus Christ (https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/english.html). His message of forgiveness, love, and eternal life is available to everyone who believes.

Remember, in Jesus Christ you are loved and valued beyond measure. The peace of Christ be with you.
